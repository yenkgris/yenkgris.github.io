            <h1>Marching</h1>
            <p>Every 22th of each month, we take over the streets of the city and peacefully protest. </p>
            <p>Anyone can join as long as you keep it peaceful. </p>
            <h1>Parades</h1>
            <p>In collaboration with many charities and NGO's, we at SeakHelp organize parades every 6-8 months with an earth theme to them</p>
            <p>These parades have Marching Bands courtesy of the National Academy of Music, parade floats from the Institute of Arts.</p>
            <P>We, of course, don't use any type of motorized vehicles (our floats are electric) or fireworks or any other contaminant </P>
            <h1>Donations</h1>
            <p>Since we are an independent organizations, your donations are what keep us afloat</p>
            <p>Remember then to only donate if you can, partaking in our protests and marches is enough.</p>
            <h1>Merchandising</h1>
            <p>We plan one day to release merchandising so supporters receive something in return </p>
            <p>The problem comes with trying to make a carbon-free system without the use of pollutants</p>
